# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Objective 
For this project, I have chosen the jewelry reviews dataset from Amazon Review and will use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin.  Additionally, use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.  


### Tasks
- Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
- Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews
- Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis (README.md)
